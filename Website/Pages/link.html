    <h1>Mont Saint-Michel: A Granite Beacon!</h1>
    <p>Originally, the island was called "Mont Tombe" (Tomb Mountain). Legend has it that the Archangel Michael commanded Bishop Aubert of Avranches to build a church on this rock. The bishop doubted whether he had correctly interpreted the sign, so Saint Michael had to appear to Aubert three times. It was only after, according to one version, the Archangel Michael tapped the bishop on the head with his finger, or, by another account, burned a hole in his cassock with his sword, that Aubert began construction of the shrine.</p>
    <p>For a long time, Mont Saint-Michel was defended against Viking raids that had seized the surrounding territories. The local community of monks remained the only one to survive on the coast. The community of canons who had lived on the hill since the 8th century was expelled by the Norman Duke Richard I, supposedly for their dissolute lifestyle, but in fact, due to their ties with neighboring Brittany, with which Normandy had constant conflicts. As a result, Benedictine monks settled here, founding the Abbey of Saint-Michel.</p>
